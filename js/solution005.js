// Remove First and Last Character

// It's pretty straightforward.
// Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. 
//You're given one parameter, the original string. 
//You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.


//P: Will we get another data type thats not a string? This will not apply for strings with less than two characters
// What if we have more than two parameters, what would be the result? just thinking out loud.

// R: Call the function and pass in a parameter
// removeChar("Development")


// E: "Development" = evelopmen
// "Dominion" = "ominio"
// "Beauty" = eaut

// P: Pseudocode  
function removeFirstAndLastChar(whatToRemove){
    // introduce a method
  
    // return the result
  }
removeFirstAndLastChar("Diligence")  

  function removeChar(str){
    //You got this!
    return str.slice(1, -1)
   
   };
   console.log(removeChar("Magnificent"))
