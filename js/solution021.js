// Function 3 - multiplying two numbers

// Implement a function which mulltiplies two numbers 

//P: working with two positive integers. We are to mulitply them both. Function name is "multiply"
//R: console.log(multiply(30, 5), 150)
// console.log(multiply(80, 20), 1600)

//E: 80, 20 = 1600
//   60, 30 = 1800

// P: write an arrow function with the name multiply. Because we have two parameters, a parenthesis is needed.
// After the parenthesis we have our expression which is a multiplication.
// call the function
const multiply = (num1, num2) => num1 * num2
console.log(multiply(50, 6))
